            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Navigating the world from Rabat to Manhattan, I, Aymane, have mastered more than just mechanical engineering; I've become a professional juggler—balancing textbooks, drones, and occasionally, my own lofty dreams! My journey began in Morocco, where mixing French and Moroccan culture was as common as adding mint to tea, setting the stage for a lifetime of blending the unexpected. Learning English while juggling French and Arabic was like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded—challenging, but I eventually cracked the code. Now, whether it's coding algorithms for AI or building robots, I’ve learned that complex problems are just puzzles waiting to be solved. My passion for machine learning and robotics isn’t just about creating cool tech; it’s about finding real-world solutions that can impact both the U.S. and Africa. From automating healthcare systems to advancing sustainable technologies, I believe my skills can bridge gaps, improve lives, and bring innovative solutions to challenges on both sides of the Atlantic. Whether it’s a rural village in Morocco or a bustling city in the U.S., the potential of AI and robotics is limitless, and I’m determined to make a difference where it’s needed most. </p>
