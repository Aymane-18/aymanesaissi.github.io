            <p>Hello! I'm Aymane, a passionate mechanical engineer and robotics enthusiast with a love for solving complex problems. My journey began in <strong>Rabat, Morocco</strong>, and has taken me all the way to <strong>Manhattan, New York</strong>, where I am pursuing innovative solutions to real-world challenges through <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong>.</p>
            
            <!-- Subsections with headers to make it more scannable -->
            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I grew up immersed in a blend of French and Moroccan cultures, which helped shape my curiosity and adaptability. I mastered three languages—French, Arabic, and English—and learning them felt like solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded! Alongside language learning, I developed a strong foundation in <strong>engineering</strong>, particularly mechanical systems and robotics.</p>

            <h3>Passion for Innovation</h3>
            <p>My passion for <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>robotics</strong> isn’t just about creating cool tech; it’s about finding <strong>real-world solutions</strong> that can impact lives both in the U.S. and Africa. I see limitless potential in these fields for improving industries from healthcare automation to sustainable energy.</p>
